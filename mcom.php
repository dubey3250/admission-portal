<span style="color:fffffc; font-size:30px;  margin-left:150px;">The course M.Com is basically a course related to the Accounting.
Master of Commerce (MCom or M Comm; sometimes Magister Commercii) is a postgraduate Masters Degree focusing on commerce-, accounting-, management- and economics-related subjects. Like the undergraduate Bachelor of Commerce, the degree is offered in Commonwealths nations.
Structure[edit]
The Master of Commerce typically requires two years of full-time study. The curriculum is usually concentrated on one subject area — such as accounting, actuarial science, business management, corporate governance, human resource management, economics, statistics, finance, marketing or supply chain management — and emphasizes underlying theory. Relatedly, programs usually include a thesis component,[1] and may be exclusively research based.[2][3][4]
Given this structure, the MCom differs from other business and management degrees: Its concentration on one area distinguishes it from generalist degrees, such as the MBA. Some universities offer the MCom in general management, [5] although this is more similar to the Master of Management than to the MBA; [6] see also Master of Business. As compared to specialised Professional degrees - such as the Master of Science in Finance or Master of Accounting - the MCom places more emphasis on theory, [7] although sometimes less on practice; generally, though, there is a close correspondence between these degrees and the related MCom; see also Master of Science in Management.
Programs are sometimes structured such that graduates are eligible for membership of various professional bodies or institutes.[8][9][10] In some cases, the institutional qualification program itself, may, in fact, be offered as an MCom degree (e.g. the Australian Institute of Public Accountants offers its IPA program as an MCom in Public Accounting.[11])
Admission to the MCom is usually on the basis of an existing Bachelor's, or similar compatible degree, generally the Bachelor of Commerce; often, an "Honours degree" will be required. Depending on the degree focus, a related undergraduate major and / or a fairly strong quantitative background may also be a prerequisite. Some MCom programs admit students from non-business backgrounds such as liberal arts, engineering, or the sciences - these programs usually require that students complete a bridging course, [12] or undertake an extended program.[13]
Post graduation[edit]
Based on specialisation, MCom graduates are typically employed in fields related to their degree foci, such as financial services, marketing and project management; graduates also often work in general management and business consulting [14].
The MCom includes a research component and thus provides access to a doctorate; progressing from the MCom, a student can pursue a Doctor of Commerce (DCom), Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) degree program.
