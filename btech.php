The Bachelor of Technology (commonly abbreviated as B.Tech. and Honours is B.Tech. (Hons.) is an undergraduate academic degree conferred after completion of a three or four-year program of studies at an accredited university or accredited university-level institution. The degree is conferred in the Commonwealth of Nations, the United States and elsewhere.
In general, the degree is awarded to those who have undertaken a degree program which is supplemented by either occupational placements (e.g. supervised practice or internships), practice-based classroom courses. Due to these requirements, the degree normally takes at least four years.
In some countries, the degree is awarded following completion of a curriculum which is career oriented, emphasizing practice as opposed to theory.
